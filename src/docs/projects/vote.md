# Getting Started

To get started, get your stencil repository [here]() and clone it into the `devenv/home` folder. From here you can access the code from both your computer and from the Docker container.

## Running

To build the project, `cd`  into the `build` folder and run `cmake ..`. This will generate a set of Makefiles building the whole project. From here, you can run `make` to generate a binary you can run, and you can run `make check` to run any tests you write in the `test` folder.

## Testing

You may write tests in any of the `test/**.cpp` files in the Doctest format. If you want to add any new tests, make sure to add the file in line 4 of `test/CMakeLists.txt` so that `cmake` can pick up on the new files. Examples have been included in the assignment stencil. To run the tests run `make test` in the `build` directory.
